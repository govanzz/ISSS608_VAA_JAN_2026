By the end of this exercise, we will be able to:\n\n- control the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in ggrepel package,\n- create professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages,\n- plot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using patchwork package.\n\n##  Getting started\n### Installing and loading the required libraries\n\nIn this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:\n\n- ggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.\n- ggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’.\n- hrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.\n- patchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.\nCode chunk below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto your working R environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork, \n               ggthemes, hrbrthemes,\n               tidyverse) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Beyond ggplot2 Annotation: ggrepel\nOne of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  geom_label(aes(label = ID), \n             hjust = .5, \n             vjust = -.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nggrepel  is an extension of ggplot2 package which provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text as in our example.\n\nWe simply replace geom_text() by geom_text_repel() and geom_label() by geom_label_repel.\n\n### Working with ggrepel\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ID), \n                   fontface = \"bold\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Beyond ggplot2 Themes\nggplot2 comes with eight built-in themes, they are: theme_gray(), theme_bw(), theme_classic(), theme_dark(), theme_light(), theme_linedraw(), theme_minimal(), and theme_void().\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  theme_gray() +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n### Working with ggtheme package\n\nggthemes provides ‘ggplot2’ themes that replicate the look of plots by Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, Fivethirtyeight, The Economist, ‘Stata’, ‘Excel’, and The Wall Street Journal, among others.\n\nIn the example below, The Economist theme is used.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") +\n  theme_economist()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nIt also provides some extra geoms and scales for ‘ggplot2’.

There are several ggplot2 extensions provide functions to compose figure with multiple graphs. In this section, you will learn how to create composite plot by combining multiple graphs. First, let us create three statistical graphics by using the code chunk below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np1 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\")\nprint(p1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np2 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of English scores\")\nprint(p2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLastly, we will draw a scatterplot for English score versus Maths score by as shown below\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np3 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x= MATHS, \n                 y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\nprint(p3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n### Creating Composite Graphics: pathwork methods\n\nThere are several ggplot2 extension’s functions support the needs to prepare composite figure by combining several graphs such as grid.arrange() of gridExtra package and plot_grid() of cowplot package. In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\n\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\n- Two-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\n- Parenthesis () to create a subplot group.\n- Two-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n### Combining two ggplot2 graphs\n\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np1+p2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n### Combining three ggplot2 graphs\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n- “/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n- “|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n- “()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n### Creating a composite figure with tag\n\n\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n### Creating figure with insert\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n### Creating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npatchwork <- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
